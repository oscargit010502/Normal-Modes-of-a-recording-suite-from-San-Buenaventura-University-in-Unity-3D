# Normal-Modes-of-a-recording-suite-from-San-Buenaventura-University-in-Unity-3D
This programs tries to simulate the behaviour of some normal modes or modal frquencies in the digital recording suite from San Buenaventura University, Bogot√°, Colombia. This was made using Unity 3D and it was presented for the 4th year sound engineering degree final project.

Please pay attention:

* this does not contains the whole project assets but the most files so that you can look throguh more or less what I was working on. 
* In the Modes LAB folder you can find an executable of the program, I recommend you to use it, so just download all the files inside that folder and before playing, I'd suggest you to read the manual (it is in spanish). You can find some pics about what normal modes the program is working.
